# FP4-F02_PyGame

Step 1:

Reflection - Looking at the lessons “getting started with Pygame”:

1)how does Pygame use the concepts surrounding OOP (think classes, methods, attributes, and encapsulation). Use specific examples from the lesson.
PyGame uses classes to create different kinds of objects that have similarities with one another (class attributes and simillar sets of attributes) but also keeps each individual item/sprite within the classes unique by giving them their own properties like size, speed, etc.

2)Could this be done without OOP? Explain.
I dont think this could have really been done without pygame, if it is possible it would require insanely complex loops and recursion which would ultimatley lead to a laggy glitchy experience.
